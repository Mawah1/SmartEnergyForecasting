📊 Solar Energy Forecasting Using Machine Learning
This project investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models—XGBoost, LSTM, and Prophet—in forecasting solar energy production (SEP) using historical environmental and operational data. The goal is to identify the most accurate model and integrate it into a Streamlit-based GUI that provides real-time solar energy forecasts (SEF) based on user inputs.

✅ Key Features
📈 Model Comparison: Evaluates performance using R² and MSE across time-series cross-validation.

🧠 XGBoost Integration: Selected as the best-performing model for real-time SEF due to its accuracy and efficiency.

🖥️ Interactive GUI: Built with Streamlit to allow engineers and homeowners to input variables (DHI, DNI, GHI, temperature, etc.) and obtain instant predictions.

🔍 SHAP Analysis: Explains feature importance and enhances model transparency.

🔄 Out-of-Sample Validation: Tested model performance on unseen 2021 data to ensure generalisation.

📌 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Prophet)

Streamlit (for GUI)

SHAP (for explainability)

Matplotlib / Excel (for data visualisation)

🧪 Future Work
Real-time data integration for dynamic predictions

Hybrid model exploration (e.g. XGBoost + Transformers)

Broader user testing for GUI improvements
